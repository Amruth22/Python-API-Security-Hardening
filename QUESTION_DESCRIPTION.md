# API Security Hardening - Question Description

## Overview

Build a comprehensive API security system demonstrating security hardening techniques, threat detection, custom security middleware, brute force protection, API abuse prevention, security headers, and vulnerability scanning. This project teaches essential security practices for building secure APIs and protecting against common attacks.

## Project Objectives

1. **API Security Hardening:** Master techniques to strengthen API defenses including input validation, authentication, authorization, and secure configuration management.

2. **Threat Detection:** Learn to identify and prevent common security threats including SQL injection, XSS, path traversal, and other attack patterns using pattern matching and validation.

3. **Custom Security Middleware:** Build layered security middleware for authentication, rate limiting, threat detection, and input sanitization that integrates seamlessly with Flask applications.

4. **Brute Force Protection:** Implement login protection systems that track failed attempts, lock accounts after threshold, block suspicious IPs, and prevent password guessing attacks.

5. **API Abuse Prevention:** Create rate limiting and throttling mechanisms to prevent API abuse, implement per-endpoint limits, and protect against DDoS attacks.

6. **Security Headers:** Configure and implement HTTP security headers to protect against clickjacking, XSS, MIME sniffing, and other browser-based attacks.

7. **Vulnerability Scanning:** Build basic vulnerability scanners to identify missing security headers, potential injection vulnerabilities, and authentication issues.

## Key Features to Implement

  - Configurable lockout duration
  - Automatic unlock after timeout

- **Threat Detection:**
  - SQL injection pattern detection
  - XSS attack detection
  - Path traversal detection
  - Malicious payload identification
  - Threat logging and alerting

- **Security Headers:**
  - X-Content-Type-Options
  - X-Frame-Options
  - X-XSS-Protection
  - Strict-Transport-Security
  - Content-Security-Policy
  - Referrer-Policy

- **Input Validation:**
  - Email format validation
  - Username validation
  - Password strength checking
  - JSON structure validation
  - Input sanitization

- **IP Management:**
  - IP blacklist for blocking
  - IP whitelist for trusted sources
  - Temporary IP blocks
  - Block history tracking

## Challenges and Learning Points

- **Security vs Usability:** Balancing strong security with user experience, avoiding overly restrictive measures, and implementing progressive security based on risk.

- **False Positives:** Minimizing false positives in threat detection, tuning pattern matching, and avoiding blocking legitimate users.

- **Performance Impact:** Understanding security overhead, optimizing validation and checking, and balancing security with performance.

- **Attack Evolution:** Recognizing that attacks evolve, keeping patterns updated, and staying informed about new vulnerabilities.

- **Configuration Management:** Setting appropriate thresholds for rate limits and lockouts, configuring security headers correctly, and managing security settings.

- **Logging and Monitoring:** Implementing comprehensive security logging, detecting attack patterns, and setting up alerts for security events.

- **Defense in Depth:** Understanding that no single security measure is perfect, implementing multiple layers of security, and creating redundant protections.
